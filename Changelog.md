## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Electron always logged in on restart** — `before-quit` hook now clears `rda_access_token` and `rda_refresh_token` from `localStorage` before the app exits
- **DBus noise on Linux** — `app.commandLine` flags (`no-sandbox`, `disable-dev-shm-usage`) suppress the `org.freedesktop.DBus.StartServiceByName` error that appeared on minimal Linux desktops
- **ipcMain double-registration on macOS** — all `ipcMain.handle` and `ipcMain.on` calls moved to module level; previously they were inside `createWindow()` and would re-register on the macOS `activate` event
- **401 on `/auth/me` at startup** — stale tokens are now handled cleanly: tries refresh token, then clears storage and shows login screen if both fail
- **Google login spinner** — `isGoogleLoading` is now exposed in `AuthContext` so `SignInPage` can show a spinner on the Google button while OAuth is in progress
- **JWT secret silent fallback** — signaling server now throws at startup if `JWT_SECRET` is not set, instead of silently using the weak default `change-me-in-production`

### Changed

- `JWT_EXPIRES` default in `.env.example` changed from `15m` to `1h` to reduce unnecessary token refreshes during development
