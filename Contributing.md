# Contributing to StreamLink

Thank you for taking the time to contribute. This document covers the development workflow, branch strategy, and code standards.

---

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork
2. Create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```
3. Make your changes and test locally (`npm run dev`)
4. Commit using [Conventional Commits](#commit-messages)
5. Push your branch and open a Pull Request against `main`

---

## Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): short description

Optional longer body explaining what and why.
```

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code change with no behaviour change |
| `chore` | Tooling, deps, config |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |

Examples:

```
feat(auth): add Google OAuth2 sign-in flow
fix(electron): clear localStorage tokens on before-quit
docs(readme): update local setup instructions
chore(deps): bump electron from 28.3.3 to 28.4.0
```

## Branch Naming

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `feat/short-description` | New feature |
| `fix/short-description` | Bug fix |
| `chore/short-description` | Tooling or dependency updates |
| `docs/short-description` | Documentation changes |

---

## What Not to Commit

The `.gitignore` already covers most of these, but always double-check before pushing:

- `.env` files in any directory — they contain secrets
- `dist/` or `build/` compiled output
- `node_modules/`
- `*.zip` archives
- `GoogleAuthID.json` or any credentials file
- `*.pem` key files

Run `git status` before every commit to confirm.

---

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled — no `any` types without a comment explaining why
- Functional React components with hooks — no class components
- All new files should have a comment at the top explaining their purpose
- Keep IPC handlers in `backend/src/main.ts` at the module level, not inside `createWindow()`

## Reporting Issues

Open a GitHub Issue with:

- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Your OS, Node version, and Electron version
